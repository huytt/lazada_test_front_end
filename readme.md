# Test front-end
##Task:
Provide an HTML page containing 2 fields where user can enter 2 urls and a validation button triggering a function.
The triggered Javascript function will use those 2 urls and parse the DOM to get the specifications of both products.
Then specifications will be displayed on the same HTML page in a three columns table with labels of specifications in the first column then the specifications in the 2 other columns.

##Specifications:
Consider two random phone product urls from Lazada, for example:
http://www.lazada.sg/apple-iphone-7-plus-256gb-jet-black-8634330.html 
http://www.lazada.sg/samsung-galaxy-s8-64gb-midnight-black-18155589.htm

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
